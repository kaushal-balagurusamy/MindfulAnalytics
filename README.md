# MindfulAnalytics
Efficiency tracker

Project idea: Mindful Analytics

(PRE - the planning that comes before)
Schedule planner 
* excel like calendar with times
* Resizable time slots
* Notifications for events
* Also comes with a span view (this shows over how many days you will be doing a task and it’s sub tasks, does not show for how long in each day but gives you an idea about how long you have to do things and shit)
* Syncing google calendar onto this app so that when other people schedule things for you or you use an external site that syncs events onto google calendar—> it also shows up on the efficiency app.
* 

Free time finder
* Create a new event that you don’t know when you wanna do, set bounds for times u can do it, our app will give u suggestions for times u can do this event

List
* Omni list view of calendar events
* Indefinite tasks without timings are supported
* Allows you to create sub tasks for each task infinitely that can be marked as completed
* This way you don’t have to just create a time for the due date, but have small tasks due before so you don’t procrastinate 
* Color code tasks in order of priority based on upcoming due dates that you’ve listed
* Idk: use Siri effectively to read in task and priorities

(DURING - while you do) 
efficiency tracker
* tracks what you actually did, forming an independent calendar of the events you did
* Allows you to contrast plans vs reality
* Imagine it works like a stop watch with a lap function, every time you switch tasks it will prompt you on what you just finished doing and ask you to rate that activity’s productivity rating, and the timer resets - this should toss a notification at you every time you unlock phone or computer so u don’t forget

(POST - analytics to help your reflect)
Graphs
* Review calendar that displays the info efficiency tracker recorded
* Pie charts that sum your most common distractions 
* Comparisons with peers so that it increases motivation to stay productive

Productivity percentage

EXTRA
* collaborative tasks that you can share w friends to complete, you get notifications when they do something
* Google Keep integration for notes you’d wanna take
